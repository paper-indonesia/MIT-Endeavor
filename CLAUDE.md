Welcome to MIT Sloan Executive Education and the MIT Endeavor Program



Dear Participant,



Congratulations on your acceptance into the MIT Endeavor Program at MIT Sloan Executive Education.

This program, developed in partnership with Endeavor, brings together an extraordinary group of entrepreneurial leaders from across the Endeavor global network to learn at the apex of strategy, innovation, and impact. We’re glad you’re here!



Over the course of five dynamic days at MIT Sloan, you will engage with world-class faculty and thought leaders across MIT’s innovation ecosystem. This is an intensive experience that leverages the significant commitment you’ve made to travel to MIT, away from your companies, to deep dive into the disruptions and opportunities of tomorrow. Our program aims to deliver new frameworks, tools, and perspectives to power the future success of your companies.



Through a mix of lectures, case discussions, and interactive sessions, you will:

Explore cutting-edge topics including AI, data-driven strategy, and critical emerging trends shaping the future of business
Gain insights into people analytics, human-centered design, and leading through uncertainty
Collaborate with peers in scenario planning exercises and develop actionable strategies tailored to your ventures
Reflect on how to harness data and technology for social good and sustainable growth
Connect with dynamic players in MIT’s innovation ecosystem: the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship, the MIT Regional Entrepreneurship Acceleration Program, and the MIT Startup Exchange*
The program culminates with a certificate ceremony, celebrating your learning journey and the extension of the Endeavor network into the MIT ecosystem.



To prepare for your experience, we encourage you to reflect on this guiding question: What are the strategic challenges and opportunities you hope to address in your company by leveraging the insights and connections gained at MIT? This will help you maximize the value of the program’s sessions and discussions.



We are delighted to welcome you into this community of visionary leaders and look forward to exploring how entrepreneurship can continue to drive growth and innovation worldwide.



Sincerely,
