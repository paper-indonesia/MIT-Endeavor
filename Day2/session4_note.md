# Data, Systems, and Society - harnessing AI for societal good

## general how to harness AI for society

### benefits to society
- its crazy bubble (maybe!)
- 1950 there is definition of AI = that mimic human inteligent/behaviour, but evolved into something automated then its AI
- humans vs machines: 
  - why chess: because its hard and to compete
- typical ai system
  - data -> algorithm -> decisions -> feedback to data
  - firm can influence decisions to
  - people and machines are interacting each other
  - most important thing moving forward is the data
    - generative AI wont solve a problem without data
    - what can solve a problem is data
    - data == everything
    - data is complex because it can be many thing
      - source code
      - transaction data
      - behavioural data
      - etc...
    - next after data, network are second important
      - it feedback the data and loop it through the system using network
    - next, decision is the most important steps
      - how to use AI to make a decision by experts
      - if its not done right, then it can be disaster
    - next, feedback
      - can be dangerous because of bias
    - depend on usecase, this process can be dangerous
  - Data science & AI
    - there are diagram in presentation file ... {{complete this from presentation file}}
    - 
- Topic on Bias
  - gender bias: black vs white
  - systemic bias: stem ads
    - because retail ads appear more to women results higher competition and much bigger budget of ads, then STEM appear ads more to men
    - if its more randomize, than it must be equals
    - randomizer can be a very effective tools to eliminating systemic bias
  - method bias
    - example: income inequality
      - top 50% and top 1% gap are super wide explonentially year to year
      - there is 2 person produce 2 different gap
      - it caused by decision making, marking or different metric, logic used in order to creating the gap results analysis
  - racial bias
    - its the data itself are bias for racial bias
    - one solution: clean up racial tag from data
    - another solution: generation approach can augmented the data to be more neutralize race/data
- Causality
  - data is most important thing
  - data didnt give cause and effect
  - on crisis 2008 morgage bubble
    - after all initiatives from economic class taken but none this levers works
    - causality is holy grails
      - in health and economic are important questions to ask
      - example: average treatment effect (randomize trails)
      - personalized treatment effect are desired, its causal argument and counter factual to the research
      - less understood subject
      - there is confounder but for the data who presented with the data it can be not-accurate because data already filtered
      - how to presented data that are more personalized (this is ongoing research)
- Ethical (framwork to filter right/wrong) decision
  - doesnt prevent human do good/wrong
  - we dont hold human and machine on the same ethical standard
    - example: choose car hit pedestrian or people in the car, the right answer must be self destruct because cant teach machine to kill
    - this can create unethical outcome from ethical decision
      - autonomous car -> choose to self destruct on even to choose whether hit pedestrian or car -> people avoid buy autonomous car -> more traffic incident because human error are higher than machine error

**fixing sistemic problem are required dynamic solutions**

## interdependency of AI system
**2 things happened in AI system**
- person who build the system
- person who use the system
- those 2 person might not aligned on the usage of algorithm (objectives differences --> create discrepancy)
- there are always facts/real things out there but upon use/build the AI system we only use our perception of the data but never the whole data set it self
- examples
    - AI Augmenting Human Skills: radiologist made into AI will be better to read/check symtomps
    - good radiologist can up to 95% accuracy
    - AI can do it to 95% too
    - but together they do 85% percent
    - why?
      - disagreement (not enough confidence)
    - solutions?
      - need to know how machine are build to get more confidence about the machine
- Algorithmic pricing and antitrust
  - amazon know retailer price and match then it create antitrust class action lawsuit
  - its a platform that simply match the price using algotihm

## GLOBAL EFFECT: algorithmic mono-culture (single point of failure)
**if same algorithm are scaled and used at large scale, the failure can be cathasthropic**
- example: HRs using same algorithm to recruit then it might fight over the same talents overs companies leaving:
  - less opportunity but scarce resources to company
  - highly competitive
  - unfair
  - one solution: should be customize (maintain some level of locality)

## generative AI
**the generation process of new data is generative AI**

## hanging topic
- ethical decision can be unethical

## problems occurred to writer
- randomizer would not be good for business since its less targeted
- while without randomizer, the market can be dictated by algorithm and even human behaviour in daily lives (can be racist for example)
- then what is the silver bullet to fix this?? hot to notice it before its too late? are at the end of the day we need roles which audits this on more perpetual process
