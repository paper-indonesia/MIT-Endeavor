# AI Agents: Building a Zero-Employee Unicorn, AI-Driven Enterprises

philosophy: society creating more problems than solutions and innovation is the best way to address this fundamental issue

most inefficient part of the company is human

## how to define entrepreneurship = 
- SME
- IDE
- and AIDE --> critical element clockspeed

## how entrepreneurship changed
"We spent 28 months reducing our workforce from 218 to 29 members, reduced burn from $2.1M/month to $300K/month, and made progress improving our core metrics. We built Copilot with 17 AI agents and an MCP server to fully align with the new AI-first era. This provides a stickier product."

## How to bend the vector (in x-axis time and y-axis impact, bend so faster and higher impact)

## facts
- more entrepreneurship and startups
- forward will be more and stronger entrepreneurs
- enterpreneurship change rapid makes high qualities, comprehensive business strategies to compete
- product development cycles reduced dramaticaly
- user acquisition trends are shorter and shorter (companies and time to get 1 million user charts)

## inteference of AI
- AIDE (AI Driven Enterprises) are sought after for make impact faster
- user acquisition are shorter with AI
- years from 1 into 100MM ARR
- charts about number of employees vs 100MM ARR
- Case study: Business with physical product
  - can outsource manufacturing
    - then at the end of the day there will be only SME and AIDE eliminating IDE
    - but this SME when embedding the AI-Embedded SME
  - can automate sales
  - customer support can be

## ARR per FTE (Annual Recurring Revenue per Full-Time Employee) ==> METRIC VENTURE BASED (very important)
- Explanation: this metric show whether or now company can generate revenue outweight the salary per employee
- Traditional SaaS: $150K-$300K ARR/FTE
- High-performing SaaS: $500K-$1M ARR/FTE  
- AI-Driven Enterprises (AIDEs): $1M-$10M+ ARR/FTE
- Example: After 28-month transformation → 29 employees handling what 218 did before (7.5x productivity gain)
- Key insight: AI agents act as force multipliers, not just automation tools

## ARR per FTE cost will be more proper pointer since the cost of employee can be added cost AI implemented
- Case Study: xxx Company Analysis
  - Sales: 2.4 trillion IDR/month (gross)
  - Revenue margin: 0.3% = 7.2 billion IDR/month
  - Annual revenue: 86.4 billion IDR = $5.76 million ARR
  - Employees: 300
  - **ARR per FTE: $19,200** (very low - 8-15x below traditional SaaS)
  - Monthly cost: 7B IDR = $466,667 → Annual cost: $5.6M
  - **Profit: $160,000 annually** (2.8% net margin - razor thin)
  - With AI transformation could potentially:
    - Reduce headcount by 90% (to 30 people)
    - Achieve $192,000 ARR/FTE (10x improvement)
    - Save ~$4M in costs while maintaining revenue

## organization charts in the age of AI
- before AI: fixed, hierarchical
- with agents: fluid
- instead figuring what people, focus on what roles needed

## AI tools
- like first pancake, the first idea baked by AI tools are useless but the iteration will make it perfect but it need to be tested and implemented

## AI is going to put entrepreneur out of the business
- AI will create and run companies
- but it will be human behind the scenes
- AI will do most of the work leaving human do/solve more bigger problem
- example entonomy

## Fact checks
- cant create fully autonomous business system with 0 human
- top management doesnt have AI expertise
- biggest risk about unprepared leadership failing drive adoptions
- AI mentioned several times every meeting but nobody on the board understand AI
- explore the research questions
  - data sources
  - text mining analysis
  - etc2...

## conclusion
- There will be survival of the efficient
- Entrepreneurs will be free to focus on solving the bigger problem
- Start with ourself

## key research

## for reflections

## hybrids
- there are AI-Augmented SME, where SME added AI capabilities which can be found internet
