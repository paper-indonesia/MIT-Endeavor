# Controlling Bias

## AI doesnt match human interpretation of data
- explained, AI is not perfect, trained specific people that this tools imperfect
- operate algorith and human share errors so AI
- recruiter and adopter should know when should override and when to use the algorithm
- explaining AI is best

## assessment overview to create and test model (9)
- effort
- attention
- focus
- risk tolerance
- decision makinjng
- learning
- emotion
- fainess
- generosity

## Bias

### how to build the model is how to spot bias and try to eliminates it:
1. create a pattern (this pattern can be implemented into the system)

### technique to building patterns (debiasing)
1. start with all measures
2. build model (SVM algorithm)
3. check mode using audit-ai (get the threshold of adverse impact)
   1. there is adverse impact --> deweight biased measures
   2. no adverse impact --> check mode using audit-ai --> debiased & predictive model

### fast thinking part of hiring
1. human vs hiring, human hiring is more humane
2. name, race, gender, etc can change hiring/selection decision

### soft skill to hiring
- evently distributed across human population
- aptitude and hard skills are bias/unfair
- antipattern: technical roles are not considered as part of pymetric company because hard skill are tested differently and yes the role might be still bias

### realtime monitoring
- check if there is no bias along the way


### opinions
1. how to transform trained data ML/predictive AI before LLM to LLM
2. non-verbal assessment: computer science activities, task of attention about impulsive vs attentive subject are
