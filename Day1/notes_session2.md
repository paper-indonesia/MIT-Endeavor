# GenAI as a New Innovation Platform

## Platform are everywhere
- many platforms are on top of other platforms
  - example: superapps on top of mobile platform and mobile platform on top of cloud platform
- Platforms are among worlds most valuable company (half of unicorn are/try to be a platform)
- platform can be reconfigured into another valueable model (its reuseable component), can create family of products then much more easier
  - internal platforms: the firm controls the platform and belong to usecase of the companies/firm
  - supply-chain platform: effects of the firms partnership get effect or get blackbox the platform from the first firm
  - industry platform: components/configurable items/not controlled by contracts (controlled by another hierarchy)
    - global network of customers, complementors & partners (draw as triagle nebulus network)  ***driven by network effect***
    - definition: product/service that serve as common foundation for individual/coporate that can enable interaction / innovation
    - the more users/complements the more valuable the platform (the network effect)
    - network effects (refer to another sub-section below)
      - self-reinforcing positive feedback loops
      - growth potential is geometric/exponential not linear
      - loss or decline potential also non-linear
    - value of the device shifted to core function, 3rd party innovator can provide
      - example: blackberry and nokia
    - platform doesnt like interopability

## network effects
- positive feedback loops
  - more user more value
  - clearest example = phone (metcalfs law)
  - 2 user = 1 connection
  - 5 = 10
  - ...
  - 1M = Ca. 500B
- there is chicken and egg problem
  - first companies must buy/start at 2 device/users similar to phone and internet browser

## what is industry platforms have in common
platform comes in many different size/shapes
- Bring together 2 or more "market sides" or critical actors
- Generate unique value from "network effects" --> generate values from 1st point
- Must solve a "chicken and egg" problem. how to create value & get network effect started
  - example: amazon, first collect several supplier (trigger side that cause other side to be attactive)
- antipattern: if you dont have chicken and egg problem, you cant have platform

## Basic platform types
1. innovation platform: provide common technology/building blocks for 3rd party to create values on top of their platform
   1. worthless without 3rd party innovation
2. transaction platforms: enable buying and selling
   1. any kind of system that enable exchange of informations (even at price of 0)
   2. example: messing service, social media, eccommerce
3. Hybrid companies: they are on both sides
   1. example: apple, google
   2. they do it sometimes seamlessly
4. they are many subtypes but transactions platform are more common (80%)
   1. because innovation platform tend to dominates market otherwise it will be very confusing
   2. 3rd party complements like they do things we dont do will make platform platforms

## argument in brief
1. innovation platform: if you can create more value by enhancing product/service with 3rd party complements, try/add an innovation platform
2. transactions: if you can create value by connecting market sides rather than creating/reselling product, try add a transactions platform

## winner take all or most (WTAoM) --> no platform take all markets
because:
1. strong network effects
2. "Multi-homing" costly, for end user, its expensive to have more than 1 platform as user preferences
3. little differentiation or niches among competitors
4. high barrier to entry
5. its possible to attack dominant platform

## how to build platform business
1. choose market sides
2. solve chicken and egg problem
3. design your business model (who want to pay. example: ecommerce have buyer side to pay fee, messaging there are advertisement). but no one want to pay if there is no early network effect (they want it free)
4. establish and enforce ecosystem rules

## chicken and egg problem
1. create standalone value for one side first
   1. doesnt need 3rd party complements
   2. your solution solves a common industry problem
2. subsidize 1 sude maybe 2 sides temporarily
   1. example: free usage, technical assistance
   2. build or buy key complmenets and bundle with the platform
3. Bring on 2+ sides simultaneously or zig-zag
   1. Pay 2(or more) sides to connect
   2. from partnerships instead of relying on network effects early on

## platformania
- platformizing bad business does not good business
  - platform should solve market failure, when one sides stop operating, the platform then stop then it is not a platform
- if platform subsidize 2 more sides for more users when network effects are not happening organically, then it will fails
  - example: uber

## platform business advice
- target industry-wide problem related to a demand-supply imbalance: "market failure" = opportunity
- design a compelling solution - standalone with platform potential or a platform from the "moment of the creation"
- design innovation/transaction platomr repending of problem/actor want to bring together
- attach chicken n eff problem offer standalone value or subsidize the most important side
- grow via netowrk effects or partnerships

## platform trends

## genai innovation history
- AI/ML useing neural network dates back to the 1950.
  - transaformer research at google 2017
- transformer for language translation: identifies patterns and creates "digital tokens" representing meaning AND context. Sequence & context used to predict what should comes next
- 1 token = ca. 4 characters or 0.75 words
- parameters ==?? 
- transformer research transform reading and language models dramatically
- energy used to learning AI are doubling every 6 months

## NVIDIA Ecosystem Dominance (2024)
- 80% market share in GenAI GPUs
- $1+ trillion market cap vs Intel $154B, AMD $159B
- H100 processors $40,000+ each, supply constrained
- CUDA software ecosystem: 250+ libraries, proprietary lock-in
- Network effects: hardware-software platform stickiness

### NVIDIA competitive advantages:
1. Architectural innovation (2006 G80 Tesla): parallel processing breakthrough
2. CUDA programming model: C/C++ extension for GPU development
3. Early AI/ML investment (2011-2017): supported university research, OpenAI donations
4. Hopper microarchitecture (2022): GenAI optimized with massive memory

### NVIDIA vulnerabilities:
- Export restrictions (China = 20-25% datacenter revenue)
- Open source alternatives (OpenCL, Triton, PyTorch)
- Cloud provider competition (Google TPUs, AWS Trainium, Microsoft custom)
- AMD/Intel price-performance catching up

## DeepSeek Disruption Analysis
- Chinese startup (200 employees vs OpenAI 3500+)

- 14.8T tokens training data (comparable to GPT-4)
- Performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Llama 3.1

### Technical innovations:
1. **Mixture of Experts (MoE)**: 37B/671B parameters, sparse neural networks
2. **Reinforcement Learning**: minimal human supervision, self-learning rewards
3. **Distillation**: teacher-student model knowledge transfer
4. **Multi-token prediction**: predicts next 2 tokens vs 1
5. **Chain-of-thought reasoning**: breaks complex problems into steps

### Market impact:
- API pricing disruption: $0.07-$2.19 vs OpenAI $15-$60 per million tokens
- Commoditization concerns for GenAI industry
- Jevons Paradox potential: lower costs driving exponential demand
- Open source acceleration: detailed technical reports democratizing knowledge
