## üìä What is a Convertible Bridge Note?

## ‚öñÔ∏è Risk vs. Reward

| **Risks** | **Rewards** |
|-----------|-------------|
| Must repay if no conversion | Discount on future equity |
| Creates debt obligation | Delays difficult valuation |
| Pressure to raise next round | Quick access to capital |
| Dilution at conversion | Lower transaction costs |

## üéØ Strategic Context for Zipcar

The $2M convertible bridge note likely served to:
1. **Fund immediate operations** while pursuing growth
2. **Bridge to institutional funding** round
3. **Avoid undervaluing** the company early
4. **Maintain momentum** without lengthy negotiations

## üìù Key Takeaway

A convertible bridge note is essentially a **temporary loan that becomes ownership** - it provides immediate cash while postponing the complex valuation discussion until the company has more traction and data to support a fair valuation.
