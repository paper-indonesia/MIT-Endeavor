## ðŸŽ¯ LP Definition in Venture Capital

**Limited Partners (LPs)** are investors who provide capital to venture capital funds but maintain a passive role in fund management. They are called "limited" because:
- Their liability is limited to their investment amount
- They have limited involvement in day-to-day operations
- They delegate investment decisions to General Partners (GPs)

## ðŸ’¼ Key Challenges from Global Ventures Case

The protagonist faced three major LP-related challenges in 2018:

### 1. **Regional LP Mindset**
```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Regional LP<br/>Challenges))
    Skepticism
      VC not seen as viable asset class
      Preference for Silicon Valley brands
      Limited regional VC ecosystem
    Gender Bias
      Only 2% of VC goes to female founders
      Credibility building challenges
      Unwritten rules in investor circles
    First-Time Fund Issues
      No track record
      Need to convert skeptics
      12-24 month fundraising timeline
```

### 2. **Global vs Regional LP Perspectives**

| **Regional LPs (Middle East/Africa)** | **Global LPs (US/International)** |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Reserved capital for Silicon Valley brands | Unfamiliar with MENA region |
| Didn't view regional VC as viable | Lacked reliable regional data |
| HNIs and family offices dominant | Regulatory concerns |
| Relationship-driven decisions | Data-driven decisions |
| Required local credibility building | Required ecosystem education |

### 3. **LP Engagement Timeline**
