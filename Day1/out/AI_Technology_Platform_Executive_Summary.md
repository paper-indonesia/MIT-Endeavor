## 🔥 **1. DeepSeek: The $5.6M Disruption**

**Revolutionary Achievement**: Chinese startup DeepSeek developed world-class AI models (V3 & R1) for **$5.6M** - disrupting the economics of an industry where competitors spend **$100M-$1B**.

### **🎯 Key Innovations:**
- **Mixture of Experts (MoE)**: Uses specialized models accessing only 37B out of 671B parameters
- **Reinforcement Learning Strategy**: Skipped expensive human pre-training, used self-improvement
- **Distillation Technique**: Large "teacher" models train smaller "student" models efficiently
- **Multi-Token Prediction**: Predicts next two tokens instead of one, improving data efficiency

### **💥 Market Impact:**
- **API Pricing Disruption**: $0.07/M tokens vs OpenAI's $15/M tokens (214x cheaper)
- **Stock Market Shock**: Caused declines in NVIDIA and GenAI infrastructure companies
- **Jevons Paradox Effect**: Lower prices driving massive demand increases, not revenue decreases
